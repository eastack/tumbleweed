<h1>5. Rust Is a Scalable Language</h1>
<p>In my last post about <a href="https://matklad.github.io/2023/03/26/zig-and-rust.html"><em>Zig and Rust</em></a>, I mentioned that Rust is a &ldquo;scalable language&rdquo;.
Let me expand on this a bit.</p>
<section id="Vertical-Scalability">
<h2>Vertical Scalability</h2>
<p>Rust is vertically scalable, in that you can write all kinds of software in it.
You can write an advanced zero-alloc image compression library, build a web server exposing the library to the world as an HTTP SAAS, and cobble together a &ldquo;script&rdquo; for building, testing, and deploying it to wherever people deploy software these days.
And you would only need Rust &mdash; while it excels in the lowest half of the stack, it&rsquo;s pretty ok everywhere else too.</p>
</section>
<section id="Horizontal-Scalability">
<h2>Horizontal Scalability</h2>
<p>Rust is horizontally scalable, in that you can easily parallelize development of large software artifacts across many people and teams.
Rust itself moves with a breakneck speed, which is surprising for such a loosely coordinated and chronically understaffed open source project of this scale.
The relatively small community  managed to put together a comprehensive ecosystem of composable high-quality crates on a short notice.
Rust is so easy to compose reliably that even the stdlib itself does not shy from pulling dependencies from crates.io.</p>
<p>Steve Klabnik wrote about <a href="https://steveklabnik.com/writing/rusts-golden-rule"><em>Rust&rsquo;s Golden Rule</em></a>,
how function signatures are mandatory and authoritative and explicitly define the interface both for the callers of the function and for the function&rsquo;s body.
This thinking extends to other parts of the language.</p>
<p>My second most favorite feature of Rust (after safety) is its module system.
It has first-class support for the concept of a library.
A library is called a crate and is a tree of modules, a unit of compilation, and a principle visibility boundary.
Modules can contain circular dependencies, but libraries always form a directed acyclic graph.
There&rsquo;s no global namespace of symbols &mdash; libraries are anonymous, names only appear on dependency edges between two libraries, and are local to the downstream crate.</p>
<p>The benefits of this core compilation model are then greatly amplified by Cargo, which is not a generalized task runner, but rather a rigid specification for what is a package of Rust code:</p>
<ul>
<li>
a (library) crate,
</li>
<li>
a manifest, which defines dependencies between packages in a declarative way, using semver,
</li>
<li>
an ecosystem-wide agreement on the semantics of dependency specification, and accompanied dependency resolution algorithm.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Crucially, there&rsquo;s absolutely no way in Cargo to control the actual build process.
The <code>build.rs</code> file can be used to provide extra runtime inputs, but it&rsquo;s <code>cargo</code> who calls <code>rustc</code>.</p>
<p>Again, Cargo defines a rigid interface for a reusable piece of Rust code.
Both producers and consumers must abide by these rules, there is no way around them.
As a reward, they get a super-power of working together by working apart.
I don&rsquo;t need to ping dtolnay in Slack when I want to use serde-json because we implicitly pre-agreed to a shared golden rule.</p>
